For now code is not in master branch as there is a delay in DB fetch which could be overcome by using joins, please use feature/app branch.

This is a sample application which elaborates google's repository pattern with MVVM design architecture. It makes usage of few utilities like Dagger, Data binding, Lambda, and generics etc.

It basically fetches data from an Open API endpoint using retrofit, stores it in room and with the help of Live Data notifies the clients of the entities.
